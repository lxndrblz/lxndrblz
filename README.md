Hello! I’m `Alexander Bilz`, and I’m a Junior IT-Auditor and Travel Enthusiast.

- 🌈 For fun, I develope static site generator themes like [Anatole](https://github.com/lxndrblz/anatole) for Hugo.
- 🛺 I'm really into travel, which I combine with my love for Python to find good deals and solve optimization problems.
- 🍱 When I’m not on a computer, I’m probably making drip coffee or searching the best fast food joint out there.
- ☕ If you want to help me stay caffeinated, you can buy me a coffee on [ko-fi.com](https://ko-fi.com/lxndrblz).
